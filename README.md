shooting-game
=============

Simple shooting game written in, kinda functional style, Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS (CSS transitions are pretty awesome, especially fun with out of range values in cubic-bezier; have a look how target behave when you hit one)

Game control: left and right arrows, shoot by space. Scoring and other game features are on the way

(for now tested only in Chrome)
